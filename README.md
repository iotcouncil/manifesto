# Council Manifesto
1. People are complex beings with clear needs, wants and dreams. People need love, avoid sickness and shame. and want to belong (if only to themselves). People die. Time is therefore important.
2. Machines are complex objects with clear needs and wants, not dreams. Machines need energy. Machines are in a perpetual now. They have no sense of birth or death. Time is not an issue.
3. The two should not be mixed conceptually. They are mixed now. This leads to confusion and anxiety.
4. We believe the connectivity can support people in our everyday lives, in our homes, in our mobility and. in our ways of building and using resources.
5. We argue that infrastructure should be open source, easily repairable and located in regions where. taxes are paid, services are permissionless and data and identity should be under full control of individuals or groups of individuals in their own devices (edge computing).
6. Then we service people and we service machines who in turn helps us to control energy resources.
7. We are a loose group of individuals who share very different ideas and opinions but build architectures, applications, devices and conceptual models from the above six statements.
8. We group United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to rethink the four IoT domains: wearables, smart home, connected mobility, smart city.
