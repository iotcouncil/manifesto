# IoT Council Manifesto
1. People are complex beings with clear needs, wants and dreams. People need love, avoid sickness and shame. and want to belong (if only to themselves). People die. Time is therefore important.
2. Machines are complex objects with clear needs and wants, not dreams. Machines need energy. Machines are in. a perpetual now. They have no sense of birth or death. Time. is not an issue.
3. The two should not be mixed conceptually. They are now. This leads to confusion and anxiety.
4. We believe the connectivity can support people in our everyday lives, in our  homes, in our mobility and. in our ways of building and using resources. 
5. We argue that infrastructure should be open source and located in regions where. taxes are paid, services are permissionless and data and identity should be under full control of individuals or groups of individuals in their own devices (edge coimputing).
6. Then we service people and we service machines who in turn helps us to control energy resources.
7. We are a loose group of individuals who share very different ideas and opinions but build arachitectures, applications, devices and conceptual models from the above six statements.
8. We group SDG's to rethink the four #IoT domains: wearables, smart home, connected mobility, smart city. 
9. Every three months we present a full reference model for each. June 1 we present our modular. and horizontally. scalable model for the neighborhood.
10. We celebrate #Iotday, April 9. On. that day we invite our neighborhoods into our homes and offices to listen and explain why people and machines as both complex beings should not be mixed.
